The Stop Motion Project
 	
Our project is a fully functioning stop motion animation generator. The user will be able to draw different frames for
animation, save them, and then play them back. Drawing options include lines, freehand drawing, circles, and different
color options.

Instructions for running the project:
(All final files are in the Project folder)
1) Compile and run "Gui.java"
2) Create differnt frames for your animation by drawing and then saving each frame as an image (the name should be
   different each time for clarity when playing back the animation)
3) Thank close the GUI and compile and run "Player.java" where you can upload each frame you created and watch your
   finished animation.
